# DP-900 Exam Notes: Data Types

## 1. Structured, Unstructured, and Semi-Structured Data

### ðŸ“Œ Structured Data
Structured data is highly organized and stored in relational databases with a predefined schema.

#### **Examples:**
- Customer records in a SQL database
- Employee payroll data
- Online transaction records

#### **Azure Tools for Structured Data:**
- **Azure SQL Database** â€“ Fully managed relational database service
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** â€“ Data warehousing and analytics
- **Azure Table Storage** â€“ NoSQL key-value store for structured data

---

### ðŸ“Œ Unstructured Data
Unstructured data lacks a predefined format and does not fit neatly into relational databases.

#### **Examples:**
- Images and videos
- Emails and social media posts
- Sensor data and logs

#### **Azure Tools for Unstructured Data:**
- **Azure Blob Storage** â€“ Stores large amounts of unstructured data (e.g., images, videos, backups)
- **Azure Data Lake Storage** â€“ Optimized for big data analytics
- **Azure Cognitive Services** â€“ AI-powered analysis of unstructured data like images and text

---

### ðŸ“Œ Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data has some organizational properties, such as key-value pairs, but does not adhere to a strict schema.

#### **Examples:**
- JSON and XML files
- CSV files with inconsistent columns
- NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)

#### **Azure Tools for Semi-Structured Data:**
- **Azure Cosmos DB** â€“ NoSQL database for JSON-like documents
- **Azure Data Factory** â€“ Data integration for structured and semi-structured formats
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** â€“ Can process semi-structured data like JSON, Parquet

## 2. OLTP, OLAP, and Data Warehousing

### ðŸ“Œ OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
OLTP systems handle real-time transaction processing with fast insert, update, and delete operations.

#### **Examples:**
- Banking transactions
- E-commerce order processing
- ATM withdrawals

#### **Azure Tools for OLTP:**
- **Azure SQL Database** â€“ Managed relational database optimized for OLTP
- **Azure Cosmos DB** â€“ NoSQL database for globally distributed applications
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL** â€“ Fully managed open-source databases

---

### ðŸ“Œ OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
OLAP systems are designed for complex queries and data analysis, typically used in business intelligence.

#### **Examples:**
- Sales trend analysis
- Financial reporting
- Customer behavior analytics

#### **Azure Tools for OLAP:**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** â€“ Cloud-scale analytics and data warehousing
- **Azure Analysis Services** â€“ Enterprise-grade data modeling for BI
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive data visualization and reporting

---

### ðŸ“Œ Data Warehousing
A data warehouse is a centralized repository for structured and semi-structured data optimized for reporting and analytics.

#### **Examples:**
- Company-wide sales data warehouse
- Healthcare patient data analytics
- Supply chain performance monitoring

#### **Azure Tools for Data Warehousing:**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** â€“ Unified big data and data warehousing solution
- **Azure Data Factory** â€“ Data ingestion and transformation service
- **Azure Data Lake Storage** â€“ Scalable storage for large datasets
